#echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who don’t want to see the underlying R code.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r youth-dist, echo=FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(age)) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

```{r race-dist, echo=FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + geom_bar() + coord_flip() + labs(x= "Victim race")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
